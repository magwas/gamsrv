This is a game server PoC.
Don't expect a full-featured one, the main goal was to show how the following issues could be handled:
- flexible architecture with separation of game logic and server functions,
	all security functions (authentication, authorisation, logging, input validation) can be implemented outside game logic (they are not actually implemented though)
	a new game logic can be inserted any time
- fast client-server protocol
- interface definition for the client and cms
	interface changes are spotted/cannot be done without careful release planning
	extension of interfaces is possible
- horizontally scaleable architecture
